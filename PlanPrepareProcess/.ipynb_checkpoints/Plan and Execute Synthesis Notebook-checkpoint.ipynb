    "* The first step to planning an experiment is to load the experiment variables and inputs from a csv file. Every variable should have an input with an acceptable datatype. At the moment this step is done by opening a CSV file in Excel, where the first column is the name of the variable and the adjacent column is the variable value. The default delimitter is (,). \n",
    "    * Reading directly as csv is fine but it requires you have correctly format strings. This forces you to put marks ('') around each string variable value when planning the experiment. NOTE: You still need to place marks around anything inside a dtype i.e components inside a list [\"component 1\", component 2\"]. However you do not need to place it around numbers or other dtypes.\n",
    "        * To remove this dependency we can build our own interpreters for our specfic cases such as to not use ast.literal_evals default unpacking.\n",
    "    * Loading from excel can be done in a similar manner but is avoided due not having xlrd or openpyxl depdenency native to python, and the opentrons being limited in the packages we can add/update. Hence we default to a CSV.\n",
    "* The experiment dictionary consist of keys being the variable name and the value being the variables value. It is important to always keep in mind the order of every variable is linear and should be assumed to be match all other variables (i.e. Component Shorthand Names index 1 = Component Concentration index 1). This assumption is the default for any function using variables from the experiment dictionary, however we can deviate it from it if needed. \n",

The upside to this case is there is no need to update the composition/concentration poriton of the dataframe as \n",

It has a downside of using more tips, however parking the tip on the tiprack may resolve this (it is already being done when switching between pipettes). Also it can allow for evaporation or other time sensitve process to occur in the time between stock additions. **THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING USED DUE TO SIMPLICITY**. \n",

Each protcol object is unique and you must keep track of the one you are using, so feel free to name it anything. Protocols can either be called as a simualtion or a execution. This object will allow use to initialize all labware, instrumentation and commands to the OT2. \n",

All that is needed is the protocol object, name of labware (which must exist in either the native or custom directory of labwares) and the slot number. \n",

    "\n",

    "* ***OT2Commands.pipette_stock_volumes*** does something notable which you may want to follow in other protocols. It returns the well of every sample created in the order it was made in a list.
